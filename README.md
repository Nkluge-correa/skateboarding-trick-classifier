# Skateboarding Trick Classifier

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/422018559.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/422018559)

This repository contains _accelerometry signals_ from an accelerometer/recorder attached to a skateboard. With it, several skateboarding maneuvers of **5 different classes** were recorded. The accelerometry signals are used to train a neural network to solve the classification task.
