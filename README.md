This repository contains _accelerometry signals_ from a skateboard mounted with an accelerometer/recorder. The accelerometer was used to record several skateboarding maneuvers from 5 different classes. To solve the classification task we trained a neural network with our dataset. We trained both a flat-dense and a recurrent network (LSTM). Ensemble models for the 'flat-dense' and 'rnn' architectures were also trained. The dataset can be found in the `data` folder and models in the `skateboarding_models` folder. You can also follow the procedure with our `Skateboarding_Trick_Classifier` notebook.
